## Description

This calendar app is a user-friendly tool designed to make scheduling and event planning a breeze. After refactoring and improving the code, the app now has the ability to save calendar events and persist them upon a browser reload, ensuring that users don't lose their valuable scheduling information. 

Working on this project has given me experience in making improvements to already-existing code, which is an excellent way for new developers to learn and grow while contributing to the development of valuable projects. It provides opportunities for practical learning, skill development, and portfolio building that can help new developers stand out in a competitive job market.
